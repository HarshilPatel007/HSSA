# HSSA
Higher Secondary Student Admission Application- Build in JAVA+JavaFX


## College Project for 4th Semester.

## Project Guide.
Dr. Richa Mehta

## Technology Used.
JavaSE, JavaFX, MySQL

## Why Java Based Project?
Frankly speaking, during my college I saw that every indivdual group of students selected Web-Based project for their project work. Mostly in PHP,MySQL,ASP.NET that's all. So, I thought not to follow this trend and do something else and finally I ended-up with selecting JAVA ( seriously I didn't knew single thing about java at that time. :P ) But, I managed to do it beacause, I know my self, I know my ability to learn online and I learned JavaSE+JavaFX CRUD Operation and mad this project. ( Thanks to GOOGLE, UDEMY, YOUTUBE, ONLINE BLOGS  & WEBSITES and thanks to those people who mad those tutorials. ).

A Very Special Thanks to Mayur Sojitra ( a JAVA+Android Master ) who helped me a lot. Who rescue me from horrible java errors. :D
